aryannaik,India,1 Review,Impressed!,4 days ago,65 Views,"I recently completed the Tableau Training course offered by Simplilearn, and I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of education and the overall experience. Simplilearn has successfully crafted a program that makes learning complex concepts straightforward and accessible, even for those new to data visualization.One of the standout features of Simplilearn's Tableau Training is the clarity with which they present intricate topics. The instructors are highly knowledgeable and adept at breaking down complicated concepts into manageable, easy-to-understand segments. This approach not only enhances comprehension but also boosts confidence as you progress through the course.The course structure is well-organized, providing a good balance between theory and practical application. Each module is designed to build upon the previous one, ensuring a smooth learning curve. The hands-on projects and real-world examples are particularly valuable, as they allow you to apply what you've learned in a practical context, reinforcing your understanding and skills.Another significant advantage is the interactive nature of the training. Simplilearn encourages active participation through quizzes, assignments, and interactive sessions. This engagement helps to solidify your knowledge and keeps the learning experience dynamic and interesting.The support provided by Simplilearn is also commendable. The teaching assistants are responsive and helpful, always ready to clarify doubts and provide additional resources if needed. The community forums are a great place to connect with fellow learners, share insights, and seek advice.Simplilearn's Tableau Training excels in making complex concepts easy to grasp and apply.

Coinman,,1 Review,All about for Simplilearn Course- Data Science,"Jul 25, 2022 08:07 AM",6910 Views,"The students are not helped in any way by explaining the subject, course contents, only the subject that is wanted to be taught. The lessons are very monotonous, the answers cannot be received about the questions asked, insufficient examples, not even worth a penny of the money you pay, narrow content topics, zero communication and no resolution in any problem. I wholeheartedly and sincerely recommend that you do not attend any of the courses, do not waste your money. Stay healthy and knowledgeable.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

avikgoon2010,Kolkata India,2 Reviews,Totally fraud and cheaters,"Jul 16, 2022 09:53 PM",1081 Views,"Hi, I'm doing FSD JAVA DEVELOPMENT COURSE from Simplilearn.Don't I am repeating my self don't ever take any course from Simplilearn. You may ask why let me clarify to by points:They called their teaching methodology is blended, i.e, 80% from their garbage quality videos 20% from more garbage quality live class.Their self learning videos are so good that you can't watch them without calling asleep.Now coming to their live class..No don't Meghnad Reddy was super instructor but you'll only get him for 1 phase rest of the phases you need to follow a ritual, which is complaining about the instructor and only after that they will replace and by doing that your almost 9 out 3 classes will pass with stupid instructors lectures you'll get only 5 or 6 okay okay sessions live.Their assignments... Ohh what to say.. they will not teach you they will not guide you..In the name of class they will only provide bunch of moron instructors their self learning videos are so great that they can cure your insomnia..So you'll ask then how are supposed to do assignment..Simple... Taking course from udemy.. Or learning from YouTube.This doesn't end their shamelessnes goes beyond this their sales team will offer you more courses at less price as you are unsatisfied with their garbage course.One more thing please don't listen to these fake reviews we were asked to put good reviews here.So please stay away from Simplilearn.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

monishmajumdar,India,1 Review,Good platform with some improvements needed,"Aug 15, 2021 02:28 PM",1404 Views,"This is my 1st-time experience with Simplilearn and I pursued the AWS Cloud Architect certification course. Below are my observations -Positives:The trainer(Mohd. Saad Leghari) was very knowledgeable.Good way to get hands-on if you're not self-motivated enough to start practicals through training from uDemy.Integrated AWS labs, that offload you from worrying about getting slapped by charges for running resources.Recorded training sessions are available in case someone misses the class.Negatives:The batch includes 90+ candidates, therefore, even if the trainer is good, his skills get limited as students ask him to repeat the same things again and again over screen share mode. Ideally, the batch size should not exceed more than 30 candidates.The trainers do not have full privileges and the trainers have to depend on the session moderator to get issues fixed. To make things worse, the session moderator is mostly unavailable and only stays active during the beginning/end of the session. A lot of time gets wasted due to this.There is no clear communication or post-training steps aren't documented like - how to submit projects, where to get the dumps/practice exams etc. They just mention these over call in the last session and is hard to follow, if you suggest, then, they ask to create ticket. I feel these aspects are not very transparent and well communicated.Overall:I feel it is better to go through these courses over uDemy(or similar platforms) to build the concepts and then join here if you need some additional hands-on experience.Otherwise, it is very hard to catch up with the sessions' pace, and Simplilearn's 90+ batch model limits the rhythm of leaning. To top it off there are candidates who keep derailing the track of the session by asking too many repetitive questions(knowing that the session is available or future reference).I would recommend Simplilearn to someone with the disclaimers mentioned above.Hope my feedback help in making a wise decision and constructive for Simplilearn to incorporate the suggestions for future sessions.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

This gives a very short time for participants to digest and experiment with the concepts.Another improvement area is that, the trainer should take-up one of the project as a part of the training session itself. This will help in easier understanding of ML concepts as well as the application of the concepts in a real projects.It is also good to use mindmap of ML topics, which gives better idea of the concepts/algorithms, when and where to apply them in real time projectsFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

It covers a wide gamut of material and sample tests for both IASSC and ASQ certification BOK, so if you're looking to certify with either of those organizations this is great practice material.The courses do require self-driven learning and study to be the most effective, which is not immediately clear when first starting. Live courses are best taken by reading up on the material and pre-recorded classes ahead of time so a more thorough understanding can be gained. With the live classes the pace can be slowed due to people not reading or studying ahead of time, which can be frustrating though it can also provide some new insights.From a technical side the process was very well executed, baring the rare internet connectivity issues, which was understandable given the COVID19 situation globally.

akhilnair1MouthShut Verified Member,India,1 Review,Amazing learning journey,"Jun 06, 2020 10:13 PM",682 Views,"I have taken data science course with python in Simplilearn.  I would say that It was an amazing learning journey. The course content was rich.The self learning videos were very good in terms of the explanation, content, examples etc. I enjoyed it because I can access at any time and start learning the course.The live sessions were very good as the presenter, Vaishali Balaji was really knowledgeable and gave additional insights and practical example about an use case which was discussed in the course. The sessions were very interactive and all the queries were clarified every time. She have gone extra mile explaining a model using ms paint and I liked that very much. She will give us real world examples for each topics. Also she have provided the content and course material which she have prepared which helped me to learn additional topics which was not thought in the class.I liked the analogy of Simplilearn that they force us to explore something by ourselves, which help us in researching and thus help us become self sufficient to solve any problem. We can also download the live video lectures later on, such that if we missed something we can go back and revisit it. The self paced videos can be fast forwarded and we can increase/decrease the speed of the video if we want to.The sample projects and assessment projects are really good and enable to do real analysis of data. It also help us to explore extra methodologies which we can be easily researched which make us self sufficient to solve real data science problem in future.Also support team is very good and they respond very promptly for the queries I raised.Overall I would suggest the course to all the enthusiast who want to begin their journey with data science.

maharaj200722,India,2 Reviews,Big Data Course - One of the best in SimpliL,"May 05, 2020 09:59 AM",880 Views,"Maria was the faculty and she was by far one of the best I have encountered during the dual masters course with SimpliL. The course itself was fast and she was patient enough to explain each concept on multiple occasions clarifying everyone's doubt. It was a great learning experience.A couple of points for the SimpliL team:Mobile App Support needs to be better, during some past courses, if I attended the sessions through the mobile app, they did not get recorded and I was marked absentClass or batch selection process needs to be scrutinized with freshers and experienced personnel segregated in some way; with IT background and non IT background people segregated; It becomes very frustrating and difficult to adjust and the level of concepts being covered also do not transcend a certain level with irritants constantly seeking permission to unmute them or share their screen. You can't expect people to do Big Data and ask what is SQL or what is DB, or people in SAS class ask similar irrelevant questions.Some way learners will need to be forced to select batches of classes - beginner, intermediate, advanced - based on their preference or SimpliL should enforce the same in some way or the otherThis is the prime reason for the 4-star review otherwise it would have been a five star from my side.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

napolayan,Bangalore,1 Review,"Negligible politics, great team, solid leadership","Apr 24, 2020 07:44 AM",977 Views,"I worked at Simplilearn for over 3 years as a senior member in the marketing team. During that time, I closely worked with many other teams - sales, product, finance, HR, ops and analytics. In my 12+ years of experience across a variety of companies - both large multinationals and startups - I can confidently say that Simplilearn easily had the best work culture.I can't think of a single instance where I saw negative politics at play. A key reason is that pretty much everything is data driven. All the key metrics are visible to all teams through the analytics dashboards. And within teams, everything is driven through objective KRAs. If you met your KRAs, then you'll get rewarded, irrespective of your manager's feelings about you(unless of course, you did something really bad behaviourally).Also, the teams collaborate really well to solve a problem or launch a product. There's very little passing-the-buck and everyone understands that the goal is to reach the solution quickly.You also get a lot of support from the finance, admin, and HR teams. I am not just saying this for the heck of it. Sure, there are rules and timelines you need to follow for financial processing or for some HR processes. But exceptions are always made when valid - no one puts up blockers needlessly. In fact, I have met some of the best HR folks(both in talent acquisition and HRBP) at Simplilearn.The overall goals are also set logically and based on data at an org level(not too aggressive so as to be demoralizing, nor very easy-to-achieve so there's no growth at all). This then gets distributed across teams and so each of the teams are similarly highly motivated to achieve those goals by collaborating.Specifically, coming to marketing, you work on the best, industry leading tools, work on problems at scale and because of the structured team, you can go really deep into your function rather than get distracted by a ton of other stuff landing on your table. Also, fresh ideas are always welcomed and if you back it up with data or logic, you will almost certainly get the support to try out your ideas. In short, it allows you to become really good in your chosen field.Personally, I would highly recommend Simplilearn as a great place to work.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

My colleague referred me to this institute. I did little bit research before joining and found that fee for this course was bit on higher side compared to few other institute but then I spoke to the team and they gave me with good pricing. Classes I attended through trainer Sachin Goswami with his simple example and real life experience example made it easy to understand the topics. OSL is simple and understandable. Initial 2 classes I had problem with webx but it was ok later on. Content and material provided is good enough to prepare for the exam. I didnt interact much with technical team but I am sure they will be helpful too. Thanks for all the support provided so far.

The structure of training was so very effective that I could take the Level one exams very easily. She has kept on guiding us on how its important to read, and sharing the experiences of people who have written the exams and what leads to the failure of exams. This helped me clearly to set my goals of the TOGAF learning.Before the training, I felt the TOGAF was so very vast and similar looking concepts. But after the training, I felt everything was indexed and its clear what each section has. Highlights of every part was repeatedly told in sessions and when we read during our week days it was in the mind. She always asked to take notes which I did.With all these, I am going to study and take the exams soon as I do not intend to forget these sessions.

You'll get quizzes also while learning and to get to know about the real industry life, you'll get real life industry projects which you can practice on Simplilearn Cloud Lab which is all included in the course. The trainers are also quite experienced and will guide you well to the course end. Mr Prateek Sharma is a great mentor to have. It was really great learning from him. Besides this the support staffs are informative, polite and punctual. They'll resolve your issues in a jiffy so you need to worry.

After searching through internet up and down I finally got a good Career Counsellor at Simplilearn “Mr. Sanjay Rejeev Gowda”, and he made me understood what will be curriculum and which program works better for the career and answered my every query each time.So I enrolled to Simplilearn’s  Data Science Master Program, I should say the faculty they have are very knowledgeable and they make you understand each and every theory and formulas and idea behind it. The faculty is very good and I can say this because few days back I have completed my “Data Science with R” program and started “Data Science with Python”, and the tutor “Prateek Sharma” & ""Harish"" he made very clear not just the coding portion but theory part as well.To all sum up Simplilearn is a terrific platform to boost your career, and am very thankful to my Career Counsellor “Mr. Sanjay Rejeev Gowda” for guiding me through and still helping to resolve all the queries.Thanks Simplilean, and thanks buddy Sanjay.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

So I was really worried to invest some money in this course but it was only until my first live class after that I felt confident that I can clear this course. That is the type of confidence, Simplilearn gives the students because the trainers will tell us the challenges which they faced during the course and since they are in constant touch with their students they will share with us the latest questions asked in the PMP exams. Also, Simplilearn platform enables the users to connect to the class even when they have only mobile because their platform is available in the Play store as well.

I noticed that you learn more with actual examples when you learn at SImplilearn and especially through their live classes.The BABOK, CBAP and PMP book can get boring and you will have to read 1000's of pages just to prepare for the exam while SimpliLearn focuses on bringing bookish knowledge to you in a concise and practical way and also in a way that you will remember before exam. The faculty is highly experienced and you get to learn from other students joining from all over the world and working in different companies.

Simplilearn was ranked at 5th position. I especially liked Simplilearn because they were affordable and also they offered online virtual classes at the same price.They have this FlexiPass that helps you enroll in multiple classes with different trainers. Now, if you are unable to attend a class they provide you with the complete recording of the session to download which you can keep to yourself and can hear it over and over again.Besides this, their course material is precise and pretty much to the point. Also, it is easy to understand. They also have lots of examples material for you to download.Their support team is fantastic. They are quick to respond though I found some technical guys to just give you utterly lame solutions for your technical issues like the one I was facing the today with regards to joining the virtual class. The technical guy simply blamed it on my browser and asked me to use another browser to attend the class that was quite dumb I would put it since the browser I was using was working until yesterday without any issues.I ended up using a different browser since I was getting late for the class. The technical guy told me to uninstall my existing browser and reinstall its latest version. I already had the latest version of Chrome browser. anyways!Barring this, I would say Simplilearn is really fantastic and does a pretty good job of online training.

There was too much overwhelming content available online and in the market and all indeed created confusion.  I finally decided to do something about it. I was hunting across various online platforms to get right insight and learning track that I came across Simplilearn's offer at the time of dusshera, I decided to apply for it. I contacted their customer care and they immediately helped to get my queries resolved. I still wanted to clarify all my doubts before jumping into the course so I dig up all the reviews, programs and whatever I could get about simplilearn and also about right institute. I again approached customer care and they were again happy to resolve my problem. I finally took up the course and found their platform indeed a nice place to kickstart my learning experience. There was flexibility about the course and it was all upon me how I can finish one module. I had to select which class I would like to attend and this feature I liked a lot. Even if I missed any class I could attend the same class in the next batch. The instructor had vast experience and possessed great knowledge of the subject. He explained from time to time various case studies from his work field and this helped me to understand the concept and the subject. Whenever I had some doubt or some issue I would drop the mail to the support team and they would immediately call me up. They also gave me amazon 1000 rs voucher when I signed up for the course. Their portal is very much user-friendly and I didn't have to fight much and was able to easily maneuver from tab to tab. The study material provided is sufficient and more than enough to build a base for understanding the concept. Site loaded faster and the technology they used was efficient for attending the live classes. I never faced any issue except my own internet connection to connect to the live class.

Right from my google search that lead to the website,  to my enrolling and continuing with sessions they have been excellent. They offered me a discount straight up and assigned a dedicate learning co-ordinator for any support and guidance. The content is great. Also in my experience they are extremely affordable compared to the same course in classroom. would definitely recommend anyone to go and check them.I wanted to do a course that is flexible to accommodate my job as well as personal commitments. I could not dedicate specific time every day for a learning routine. So I wanted a course that could cater to all these needs as well as it not too heavy on the pocket. Data science with SAS course in the classroom was costing me 5 times the cost I got it on simplilearn. So that alone was the reason for me to join. and then the course content is simple as well as detailed and I haven't till now found any difference from a classroom course.It is very user friendly and I haven't had any logistics problem till date like content not loading, or slow speed etc. So till now no complains.

lfoster,,1 Review,"Easy to use classes, wonderful customer service","May 03, 2017 11:16 PM",3422 Views,"I am using Simplilearn's self paced course on ITIL Foundations. The material is covered well and in a way that makes the material easy to understand. I enjoy having a self paced course because it allows me to stay on certain topics until I get a very solid understanding of that chapter before I move on, and in doing so, I am not holding anyone else back.I appreciate the knowledge checks. The questions seem to be in line with questions I should expect on the exam. I have taken a few practice tests outside of Simplilearn over chapters that I have covered so far, and have nailed them, which lets me know that their material and practice questions are exactly on track for what I need to know.Going through the coursework is easy. I am taking longer than what the slides suggest because my best way of learning is through taking notes. If you are a visual or auditory learner, these would be a breeze for you.Their customer service has been top notch. Today I contacted Simplilearn customer support to find out how much time I had remaining to complete my lessons. I'm a little strapped for time right now and Sheena was able to come up with a good solution, very quickly. She kept me a very happy customer and went above and beyond my expectations. Every time I have contacted them, the rep has been friendly and helpful. Contacting customer service was easy as well. I prefer being able to chat with support and they do offer that option. Sheena and I had a plan worked out but I wound up needing to contact her again. It was easy to restart the chat and request to speak to Sheena. It took less than a minute from the time I started the chat to get back to Sheena.If I need more online lessons, I would not hesitate to use them again.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

askarvin,Bangalore India,1 Review,Simplilearn everything!,"Apr 03, 2017 05:16 PM",4338 Views,"While searching for a course in Scrum, I must have come across all the possible websites and content providers out there. But none had the offerings of the profound course contents, simulated exams and good support like Simplilearn. I wanted to pursue a course not for the sake of certification but for the knowledge it should impart. Simplilearn had exactly the same thing I had in mind.I registered for Agile Scrum Master course which contained self paced learning as well as live classes. Our coach Mr Jeff Allen from Ohio was amazing. He has been working in project management area for more than 20 years, very patient and immensely knowledgeable. Simplilearn has the option for re registering for a live class multiple times if you want or miss one. Six months of course access should be enough to gain. Most of the courses have exam fees included- two thumbs up for that! Registering for the exam was breeze too.The great thing about them is the customer support they provide. Whether you have some queries related to payments or promotions or even the course contents, they respond the same day. Starting from the registering the course to the after sales support, everything was fine. Even after the expiry of my course, Sheena in support was able to guide me thoroughly to register for my exam. To me this is a significant point for loving them. My next courses whatever they be- I’m simply learning for sure.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Simplilearn
andy0603,Hyderabad India,1 Review,Simply awesome !,"Mar 28, 2017 04:17 PM",4232 Views,"I enrolled for TOGAF training from Simplilearn in March 2016 . Before joining, I had consulted a few people from my organization who had attended in-person trainings from an accredited person, and had completed the TOGAF certification. I was a bit skeptical about an online/web-based(though classes are virtual training conducted over the web, with the presented going over simplilearn togaf pdfs)The virtual training was very helpful, and the instructor Mr. Hassan Gardesh was very knowledgeable. I found the virtual training flexible, since there were some batches on the weekends(4 hours each on sat-sun, for 4 weekends, if I remember correctly). Also, one could switch to a different batch if not comfortable with the timings and/or the instructor himself.In addition to the classes, videos were made available, and the pdfs for these videos were available for download. There were other material also available, such as practice test papers, puzzles, reference cards, togaf case study, etc. Also, they make the recordings of the classes available for later review and reference.After the classes, I was planning to go through the videos, materials, and take up the certification exam. I could not take up the exam because of ill health. The certification exam voucher that was given to me was valid till March 31, 2017. After numerous unsuccessful attempts to kick-start the preparations again(midst of bad health, family issues, etc etc. - there is always an excuse, right?), I was finally reaching towards the deadline of March 31, 2017, and the situation now was do-or-die. The simplilearn staff(Syed Moshin, Manager - Inside Sales) was very helpful in extending the access to the videos, until the very end - the support is awesome!Made sure that I went through all the videos(part I and II), noted down the questions and their answers towards the end of the videos. While going through the videos again, I had a feeling of deja-vu, I remembered the discussions with Mr Hassan, the concepts behind the lessons. Having worked on a software development project in Canada which followed TOGAF(although I was doing integration architecture, not EA), I could relate and had familiarity with the processes being followed. In addition to the Simplilearn videos, I took up some togaf mock tests from openarch.com. I was failing(on the brink) in the mock exams from openarch.com and passing with flying colors on the simplilearn mock tests), and was worried about the complexity of the real test, and hoping it wasn't as complex as openarch. Was pretty sure that I should be able to pass the Part 1, and was thinking will fluke Part 2. Found the level of the exam almost similar to the simplilearn mock tests(just a notch higher in complexity), and a some questions were directly repeated.Being able to press the'complete' button with predictability of Part 2 seemed close to impossible to me. I was pretty sure that I answered to the best of my ability, and there was no point in a 2nd revision. To my pleasant surprise, I passed both the parts - part 1 with 75%, and part 2 with 80%. Still cannot believe - I am now a Open Group Certified TOGAF professionalMy 2nd round of studies lasted only for around 20 days, with the last week being the only where I was putting in 6 hours(8 hours towards last 2 days, maybe). I feel I could have done a bit better if I dedicated some more time, and went through the Mr. Hassan's class recordings, perhaps put some more effort on Part 2, I would have gained more self-satisfaction.That said, I rate my Simplilearn experience at a 5 stars, will recommend simplilearn to all. The material/videos in themselves are sufficient to get people to pass the exam. Some questions from openarch will get you to believe that the simplilearn content doesn't have complete coverage of the togaf course material. But I believe, only 5% the questions in the real test were such. One of the issues that I faced in my 1st attempt was that the videos would not play from home at all, which I found was rectified in the 2nd round of my preparation. I recommend going through the G117 provided by simplilearn(A Pocket Guide) for complete coverage. Am planning to take up COBIT next, and definitely the preferred trainer is Simplilearn!Please send a message to me on mouthshut, if you wish to ask any questionFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

This session was conducted by brilliant Mr. Ranga Raju K.This is by far my favourite session ever in Virtual Trainings. I am not big fan of Trainings as I cant sit still for too long and if I am in session for half hour everything around me starts fading in few minutes. To get me trained means tying me to chair and making me sit in one place for whole 7 hours which is impossible. Virtual Trainings is something I never attend as I have option to run away.But today I attended this Virtual Training of Prince 2 by Raju Sir and I have to say I am totally speechless and impressed. Session was interactive, informative, concepts were explained with live examples and were made so simple that after session also I am able to recall everything. Its like they are imprinted on my mind through this acronyms which were shared by Raju Sir. Technique was so unique wherein Raju Sir were talking as well writing it so we can read it. Chat window was open for expressing ourselves and ask questions. Most of the questions were answered there and then and few which were kept aside were explain when topic came up. Summarization and bullet points, interview questions, exam questions the whole content and structure was amazing.Before joining this course I spoke with Venu from Bangalore office and I have to say the way he interacted and discussed with me and advised between courses is also impressive.

mranjank,bangalore India,2 Reviews,A good way to serve your learning appetite !!,"Jan 06, 2017 08:56 AM",7259 Views,"I enrolled with their online Big Data and Hadoop developer course. I had always wondered where and how do I start learning about big data. Went through many web sites, many short videos, course and material but always had trouble finding a systematic way of learning. At Simplilearn once I started watching the video and attended the Instructor Led Training classes I was clear. I have had the opportunity of communicating with two instructors. Both seems to have good knowledge of the subject matter, teaching style and delivery content may differ. But at the end you will be on your way of learning and at least achieve a preliminary expertise on Big Data. Their support staff, back office, teaching staff ate quite responsive and approachable. Portal has communities which responses within 24 hours. Never had any issues.  If you want to get a preliminary understanding and make things clear I highly recommend simplilearn.comFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

At only a fraction of the price offered by'official training centers' I was able to get comprehensive training programs for both certifications and access to the video lessons for 6 months to learn at my own pace. The video lessons are also available as printable slides for'offline' review.  Not only were the lessons and materials available to me 24/7, the support staff was also available any time I had a technical question as well as, thankfully, any questions about coursework. I had a particular request to separate the two courses and the staff quickly provided the solution to me. Yes, it defeated the purpose of offering this as a single course but the support staff helped without question.

There are few drawbacks though.1- The instructor looks like a robot, dosnot show any emotions and talk in a straight tone without ups and downs of the speech.2- For Six Sigma, there is no exam and you can get a certificate of achievement upon watching(or simply let your computer on overnight to play all the lessons) 85% of the lessons.If the video lessons are taught by a human and at the end of the course, simplilearn conducts and exam to give you a certificate, that is something which I would simplilearn to include in their courses.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

pnav81,Mumbai India,1 Review,Good online course and efficient staff,"Sep 30, 2016 11:28 PM",13781 Views,"I took the Agile Scrum Master(ASM) online training- self paced learning. I was initially doubtful of how good the self paced learning would be but the training videos are quite comprehensive and covers a wide range of topics. Plus, they are available for unlimited viewing for 180 days. It also includes a downloadable e-book, which is basically PDFs of most of the slides from the videos. While I am quite happy with the training videos, I do feel the e-book would have been a better reference document if it contained some concise notes to go along with the slides. Although, I still have to take the ASM exam, I feel that I have at least a good shot at it after taking this training. I also do have to mention that the online support staff is very helpful, polite and knowledgeable, especially Sheena.

My friend owns a coaching institute and he was the one who recommended this to me as I was working and couldn’t attend classes and his suggestion was extremely helpful in my career. I enrolled in the PRINCE2 foundation and Practitioner.There was an option of instructor training and self training and I chose the former. But anyone who wants to save some bucks can opt for the former although I highly recommend taking the help of an instructor. I say this because my instructor was very helpful and taught very well.

It's a one of the website for learning anything.  I think that it's better than nptel and edx because we can learn course material  and also get certificate of that  course free.  If you want to get that course free for that you will apply for financial aid application.  But in edx and nptel you can learn anything free but you must pay for certificate. I want to inform you that for your resume  value of edx and coursera certificate equally. But one problem are there that if want to apply for financial aid form than  approx 15 days time take to approve your application. My advice for you that if you want to do any course at low money then this course will be beneficial for you.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You! We appreciate your effort.,Coursera

Back then coursera used to offer all the courses for free, but unfortunately I didn't do any of the courses at that time. When I felt the need of enhancing my techinal and soft skills through some online courses, I found that material on coursera was great but it no longer had free courses. It asks for huge amount of money, around 3000-4000 per course. Although it has financial aid but it's just for name, and is not available for everybody. I tried to apply for financial aid, which demands hell lot of details and even after waiting for some 2-3 weeks for the application to be accepted, it most of the times, ends up being rejected. It has in a way, become profitable organization from being non profit organization. Although it has wide range of subjects and courses nut the course material on coursera can be substituted with that on udacity atleast for technology courses(computer science oriented), and that too free of cost. Although the the way of teaching and the course material was good and informative but it is of no use to students who can not afford to pay its fees.So, yes I would other sites like NPTEL which is a government site and provides courses and certifications free of cost, and Udacity, which allows to take courses for free but demands money for certificates.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You!

The course work is duly syllabic and is organised well to fit in as per an individual's requirements. To get started with you need to create your own account on the website. Account creating is pretty easy. Just the thing is that you need to provide a certain ID proof and submit your photo on live feed for the account confirmation. This doesn't take much of a time. Once done you are ready to goThere are video tutorials that one has to undertake and there are no fixed classes. Yes that means you can easily log in to your account and complete your course as an when is suitable to you. Now they are quite particular about the user accounts since Coursera.org offers various courses that are from well known universities from around the globe.This means that at the end of the course you are bound to get a certificate for your course work. Well that of course means that you have to do the assignments and answer the weekly tests given by them. After completing a certain number of assignments and term work the course concludes with the Varsity certificate(University that offers the course) .Not all courses can get you a certificate. But then you skills are a notch high once you take one of these classes and are able to complete them.The duration of a course can last for over 2 months or 2 weeks depending on the course requirement and the amount of time one is comfortable to spend on completing it.Some of the courses offered for engineering students are basic C and C+ and they can go on to something as interesting as music signal processing using Digital Signal Processing and System and Signals techniques.All and all coursera.org is really good in harnessing one's skills and adding that little required waitage to your resume.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Heng2005,Amsterdam Netherlands,144 Reviews,Experiencing Ivy league Education,"Aug 16, 2021 07:17 PM",1472 Views,"I did a few courses with coursera.org. The good thing about this website is it is free. It's good if you want to try out if you wish to further a serious education on the ""real campus"". However, some of the courses are not accredited and there are too many students enrolled in the each class (of course you have to pay if you want to be accredited). If you can't follow it, you can just withdraw the class.Courses provided are predominantly in English. There are some courses in French and Spanish. I don't understand why students complain when there is no subtitles on the video. If the course is given in English, language ability should be pre-requisite requirement.Even though it is an online course, you still need to devote 3-7 hours a week to follow the video and do some reading. Most of courses are in introductory level so it is not difficult to follow. Its assessment is a combination of weekly quiz format and sometimes final essay. They usually have small quiz during the interval of the video. Those who failed to download video, they also provide study's script.The discussing board is available. However, due to a large number of students, you will see a lot of weird comments from some students.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Coursera

Back then coursera used to offer all the courses for free, but unfortunately I didn't do any of the courses at that time. When I felt the need of enhancing my techinal and soft skills through some online courses, I found that material on coursera was great but it no longer had free courses. It asks for huge amount of money, around 3000-4000 per course. Although it has financial aid but it's just for name, and is not available for everybody. I tried to apply for financial aid, which demands hell lot of details and even after waiting for some 2-3 weeks for the application to be accepted, it most of the times, ends up being rejected. It has in a way, become profitable organization from being non profit organization. Although it has wide range of subjects and courses nut the course material on coursera can be substituted with that on udacity atleast for technology courses(computer science oriented), and that too free of cost. Although the the way of teaching and the course material was good and informative but it is of no use to students who can not afford to pay its fees.So, yes I would other sites like NPTEL which is a government site and provides courses and certifications free of cost, and Udacity, which allows to take courses for free but demands money for certificates.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You!

The course work is duly syllabic and is organised well to fit in as per an individual's requirements. To get started with you need to create your own account on the website. Account creating is pretty easy. Just the thing is that you need to provide a certain ID proof and submit your photo on live feed for the account confirmation. This doesn't take much of a time. Once done you are ready to goThere are video tutorials that one has to undertake and there are no fixed classes. Yes that means you can easily log in to your account and complete your course as an when is suitable to you.

After completing a certain number of assignments and term work the course concludes with the Varsity certificate(University that offers the course) .Not all courses can get you a certificate. But then you skills are a notch high once you take one of these classes and are able to complete them.The duration of a course can last for over 2 months or 2 weeks depending on the course requirement and the amount of time one is comfortable to spend on completing it.Some of the courses offered for engineering students are basic C and C+ and they can go on to something as interesting as music signal processing using Digital Signal Processing and System and Signals techniques.All and all coursera.org is really good in harnessing one's skills and adding that little required waitage to your resume.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

The course syllabus and format were clearly mentioned. After signing in you'll be informed about the number of hours you need to dedicate on a daily or weekly basis. There were video lectures, review materials and links provided which serve as a great source of learning.

One can find lectures from top uiniversities like Standford too!One can find a variety of different categories in this website right from engineering, medicine, law to philosophy and even psychology!I have tried a few courses in computer languages such as java and python and it really felt amazing to see how the proffessors teach us with so much ease and creativity. They provide us with timely notes and assignments which is really good for testing our own knowledge and understanding and how much we have grasped. Even during the video they automatically pause the video and ask relevant questions which is very useful to keep ourselves attentive to the lecture.One just has to register over the website and he/she can access over a variety of free lectures. But for specializtion/ certificates one has to pay a minimum amount of cash. It is really worth it though, considering the way in which we are taught.I have tried various different websites such as UDEMY etc but the amount of categories / subjects available on this site is much more than any of the other online education websites.

The good thing about this website is it is free. It's good if you want to try out if you wish to further a serious education on the ""real campus"". However, some of the courses are not accredited and there are too many students enrolled in the each class (of course you have to pay if you want to be accredited). If you can't follow it, you can just withdraw the class.Courses provided are predominantly in English. There are some courses in French and Spanish. I don't understand why students complain when there is no subtitles on the video. If the course is given in English, language ability should be pre-requisite requirement.Even though it is an online course, you still need to devote 3-7 hours a week to follow the video and do some reading. Most of courses are in introductory level so it is not difficult to follow. Its assessment is a combination of weekly quiz format and sometimes final essay. They usually have small quiz during the interval of the video. Those who failed to download video, they also provide study's script.The discussing board is available.

sahindogukaan,India,1 Review,They Block My Access for No Reason.,"May 20, 2023 12:49 PM",543 Views,"I've been a member of Udemy for 4 years.  I had so many courses and spent so much money.  They blocked my access to my membership without a proper explanation.  All I did was open a new membership and buy a discounted course for my original membership. Discounts are always happening. There's no trickery there. Also, they shouldn't block access to a student who has purchased that many courses. They didn't give me a warning or ask me what happened. Out of thin air, they do this without hesitation. I will sue them if they don't open my account. What exactly have I violated?  Either they open my account back or I will start the legal process about it. They should open my account urgently. I will initiate legal action. I will never buy a course from them again after my account open to access or all expenses paid to me. They are not a reliable company for me. They don't have a proper explanation. I didn't do anything wrong. This is very wrong what they are doing. They're doing this to a trainee who has spent thousands of Turkish Lira. Look, I'm a lawyer, I know what a contract is. What you are doing now is nothing more than trampling on my rights. If I ask for Udemy Credit, you can say we will not refunding. And that’s all. What is access blocking, what kind of reaction is that? Where is the proportionality principle? They are not reliable. Udemy is over for me. But I have purchased so many courses, and for that they have to OPEN that access. Or you'll reimburse me for all I've done for four years. Tell that the guy who took this decision, if you are doing an access block, you have to also explain it properly. Your reason isn't even clear. OPEN MY MEMBERSHIP NOW. The first thing I do on Monday is to apply to the Consumer Arbitration Committee. I will start the legal process. You don't even realize the damage you've done.

On a comparitive basis with other websites, Udemy offers very good discounts and range of courses espcially for Marketing students.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Vkchandan7,,1 Review,Name of Website,"Feb 15, 2019 04:14 AM",7239 Views,Substandard. It is derogatory and against the democratic as well as human rights. Mouth shut name is intimidating to others and I don't like this name at all. This kind of insulting web sites are a key to fail a business. Those who ask others to shut their mouths are considered bullies. The mentality to suppress others for example students can produce only employees and not leaders. They can produce crammers and not inventors or social reformers.Those who try to shut others moth must shut their mouth and learn to respect others.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

shivam9730,new delhi,6 Reviews,Best online learning platform,"Dec 03, 2018 02:46 PM",10711 Views,"This is the perfect online learning platform I have found so far. It's easy to use. And the best thing in my experience: most of the courses on Udemy are more practical than other online learning sources. If you like something short, to the point, you will like the lessons on Udemy. But if you like learning theory, I suggest you go elsewhere.Another thing, before you purchase a course, you should make sure to watch the free preview videos. Some teachers on Udemy, although they are great, they don't speak English as their native language. Make sure you can understand your teachers before you really purchase his/her course.A tip for saving money on Udemy: purchase their courses in a sale season, like Black Friday, Christmas. Yearly, Udemy will have a time that they selling all courses for around$10. I usually purchase all the courses I need one time in a year only.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

uttkarshasawai1208,India,1 Review,Personal experience review,"Sep 08, 2023 08:59 AM",2239 Views,"I can't emphasize enough how utterly disappointed and frustrated I am with myexperience with Unacademy's Judiciary Exam Preparation course. This review serves as a stern warning to anyone considering enrolling in their services; do yourself a favor and look elsewhere for your educational needs.In June 2023, I was excited to embark on a journey towards preparing for the Uttarakhand Judiciary Exam. With great enthusiasm, I decided to invest my time and hard-earned money into Unacademy's highly-touted three-month live + recorded online class batch, which promised to be the gateway to their success. However, what followed was nothing short of a horrendous nightmare.First and foremost, I paid a hefty sum of ₹9499 for a course that was marketed as a three-month live online class batch. The anticipation was palpable as they eagerly awaited the commencement of their studies. However, the reality couldn't have been farther from the promises made by Unacademy.Instead of the classes I paid for, I was provided with the incomplete pre-recorded lectures and no live classes which they promised. This wasn't what I signed up for; wanting a dynamic, interactive experience of live classes to help her grasp the complex concepts required for the Judiciary Exam. It was evident that Unacademy was using these subpar recordings as a placeholder for their lack of expertise and commitment.As if that weren't infuriating enough, the situation took a turn for the worse when I tried to contact Unacademy for clarification and resolution. Shockingly, Unacademy simply chose to ignore all my pleas for assistance. Emails went unanswered, and phone calls were met with silence. And after non-stop efforts to reach the Unacademy help, they refused to refund the amount, stating no refund policy even when they did not fulfill the purpose for which my hard earned money was given. It is as if Unacademy believes they can take people's money and disappear into thin air without any consequences.Unacademy's actions are not just a disappointment; they are a disgrace. They are cheating students with their empty promises, demonstrating a complete lack of integrity and commitment to their customers. My hard-earned money has been squandered on a service that has proven to be nothing short of a scam.In conclusion, I urge anyone considering Unacademy for their educational needs to think twice. They do not have the caliber or ethics to deliver on their promises. I have been left cheated, disillusioned, frustrated, and her crucial time has been wasted, which also impacted my self-study preparation, and I wouldn't wish this experience on anyone else. Stay far away from Unacademy and save your money for an educational institution that actually values its students and delivers on its commitments.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You!

ramgirianmol3,India,1 Review,Absolutely ridiculous,,5472 Views,"Not good!Unacademy is good support to a CAT aspirant but cannot replace your CAT coaching classes, here’s why:1. Unacademy lacks physical interaction. The most important thing when preparing for any competitive exam is learning from peers and getting into the atmosphere of learning. This helps you more than you can imagine right now. If I just go to my classes every day and meet like-minded people it pushes me to work hard. This, compared to Unacademy where I just sit alone, watch some videos, and go back to my prep.2. Non-existent doubt clarification - Doubts while preparing especially for Quant, and DILR are urgent and you cannot go ahead without solving them UA is trying to better here but coaching classes are always going to be ahead in this area as physical interaction is a must for doubt clarification. UA has a doubt-asking feature which asks you to upload a photo of the question, it is helpful but only for Quant. In a class you really cannot go with an LR set, you will feel hesitant doing that.3. It's a fish market! UA is like YT Premium, subscribe and watch or don’t! No one cares what you do, no one knows you exist. The First 2 months of your prep will be wasted in trying to find the right educators and adjust in a batch, then mostly like me, you will subscribe to individual courses which are tiring to follow up because they insist you join live classes and you cannot do 2 live classes if timing clashes, so you attend recorded but then you have doubts which the educator cannot solve because it is a recorded class and pressure mounts. Most of the educators at UA join somewhere from their bedroom and overall I don’t think there is any quality moderation. Only some teachers are excellent and to the point.4. The biggest scam of UA is the ICONIC subscription. I almost paid double and got ICONIC which only gives you access to a dedicated mentor or they think they do. This so-called mentor could be a person who never got into IIM or who scored 95%ile or any random person. That’s fine too until I get a proper resolution from a specific mentor, but THEY KEEP ON CHANGING THE MENTOR! These so-called mentors change every week, and they give you free 10 mins ice breaker sessions where you connect with the new mentor and introduce yourself and understand more about them. I got around 7–10 mentors in 3–4 months and then I never used that tab again and wasted my 10000 rupees on this useless feature.5. No notes for ICONIC students. So you are paying the same amount as the current ICONIC student but since you joined early you won’t get physical notes. UNETHICAL, AND IMMORAL!6. Now let’s talk about how is learning.Very bad! The teachers do all sorts of coaching and turn on their webcams and come live to teach on Unacademy and go back to their routine, it is a side hustle for most of them except some.7. They won’t provide any DPP or practise paper for you to practise you STILL HAVE TO BUY TIME’S MATERIAL OR CL’S MATERIAL. So add that to your fees as well.8. If after reading this you want to go ahead anyways, watch classes of Ravi sir for Quant, LRDI, and GK. In verbal Shabana madam is good. Karishma madam was good but her sessions now involve too many irrelevant topics. If you are not good in Quant, Udit Saini sir for Quant. GD-PI is not good for UA, so no one.9. No Mocks!So if you are thinking let’s pay whatever 24K and get started anyways it is cheap than the coaching institutes, you are mistaken. You are not getting notes, mock tests, and GDPI prep which you do get in a classroom program. UA has mock but they are very few and nowhere near the quality provided by TIME or IMS.10. Personal suggestion-I would recommend joining a classroom course on weekends if you are working and if you are a grad student, join on weekdays and practise on weekends(the most important part of your prep - Self-study). And if you are well off you can buy Unacademy plus for watching a specific class again or using the ask a doubt feature while practising from home. Do not buy UA. It is a modern way of wasting money. Learning is not supposed to be done sitting at home watching a screen. Go out, make new friends, meet teachers who will help you later in life, sit at a desk, learn from the board, and enjoy going home after classes. Trust me this is the best! Some offline classes that are good are TIME and IMS. It depends on the centre so read the reviews book a trial class, and spend some time finding the best one.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You! We appreciate your effort.",Unacademy

I am regretting my decision to select UNACADMY and wasted one precious year of my daughter. Below is our experience with them.We bought NEET UG 2022 iconic subscription for my daughter on 03-June-21. The subscription ended on 02-Jun-22 after one year. As the exam got delayed and date was on 17-July-22, we requested them to extend it till exam time, and charge us accordingly, but they didn’t agree to it. Instead, they were forcing us to buy minimum 3 months subscription. This shows, they are only money minded and don’t care about student’s study and future.As we bought iconic subscription, a mentor was assigned to us. We had no choice in his selection. They randomly assign someone without even knowing what type / level of mentor is required for student.The mentor was useless. He was MBBS student and was not able to guide my daughter properly.On our repeated request they never changed the mentor and hence all our money for iconic subscription got wasted.The teachers are average(They may have few good one, but the one we came across were not that good).No sufficient practice and mock tests were conducted.

Then he started irrelevant questions like profit and loss type. He did not ask even a single question where I can feel that yes he/they genuinely looking to hire and Interview. And then he wrapped the interview in hardly 10 mins. Then I received that I have not been selected. Neither got the feedback that why I have not been selected.

I have seen many linkedIn profile for the same posn where people are workinh with sales experience and even less experience.

gauravdeora555,India,2 Reviews,Review about Unacademy,"Oct 02, 2020 12:22 PM",5152 Views,"The reviews are about Unacademy, based on my experience and nothing personal. The organization asked to go through couple of steps right from making demo video, introductory video, 5 lessons on any subjects of your  choice and google form which has 4 questions and you have to write min 300 words for each. After doing this you get response after 1 or 2 weeks.In my case they made it confusing by adding the videos of the lessons again by mentioning about time duration of the videos so i did 3 times. After 2 weeks i asked about the confirmation of selection process and they said your profile is under review.Patiently waiting  I checked their live classes where I observed that students can enter the class and attend. But surprisingly I saw students with vulgar names join classes which offends especially female trainer and unacademy has no criteria to look after this serious issue, although  I recieved an official video from them that such issues are taken up seriously but its not actually. I took screen shot of those who join class with vulgar language and send it to organization and they replied that concerned team will asses. After a week or so i decided to pick up a job as they were delaying the process which is fine as it is their way of functioning and i cant have issues with it. So I dropped a msg about dropping out from unacdemy and in return they showed concern as to why i want to drop out and then i told the reason after which these people played so smartly, cleverly and  told that your experience and qualification is not meeting our requirements.. I laughed at this that these people didnt want to select me and when i wrote such thing, immediately they realized that my profile is not suitable . Such a big shame.

It also helps in visulaising of concepts in a much more effecient manner.3: They also provide test serice every week which keeps the students updated about where thet stand on a national basis.

I am a SSC aspirant so I decided to take some of the free lessons from this website. When I put the domain of this website on my browsert hen the website takes lots of time to load its front page. But when it load then I find that the navigation options of this website is not working properly.

bkcdi791,Uttrakhand (Nainital)  India,16 Reviews,My 1 month unacademy experience,"May 11, 2020 08:01 PM",1919 Views,Today I'm going to tell my 1 month Unacademy experience.1 - My genuine feedback for Unacademy.The thing I liked most about Unacademy is no distribution among students . But in offline classes there classes are divided because of Mark's.2 - Doubt discussion.I have noticed that usually  most of the students have a fear of asking about their doubt . They aren't able to ask their doubt just because they think that if they will be wrong so teacher might give him/ her punishment. But in online classes it's totally different specially we get best classified facilities for clearing our doubt and leading us towards a good direction.3 - Money.It's really a major point to discuss money is a thing which is really important just for example mostly schools 11th class fees is minimum 4 to 5 thousands which is a big amount and some families aren't able to afford this amount so for those who can't afford that amount.unacademy is a fabulous option. If one person buy unacademy subscription so his friends and his other guys who wants to study they can study together which is really a great thing.So these are my honest review for online learning platform or Unacademy. Let me know what you guys think.Thank you for reading.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.,Unacademy

Ritviksanrai,Lucknow India,6 Reviews,Your Platform to success.,"Mar 18, 2019 04:51 PM",29859 Views,"I joined unacademy last year and I was very much conscious about my preparation. In my opinion, it is the best platform to start up with your preparation because it gives you a lot more option in terms of examination choice for which you want to have your preparation. As we all know the founder of unacademy is Mr. Roman Saini who himself had cleared AIIMS and then UPSC(IAS), so this gives a kind of texture because he himself teaches on that and he is also having a very good faculty team to coordinate all. Most of the exam preparation have been covered under that like UPSC, CAT, GATE, BANK PO etc. It also provides a learning facility for school going students(class 9 to 12). The main plus point of this site is that it has very good and useful content plus a very interactive user interface. One thing more which I like is that you don't have to depend on a single content because you can get much content on the same topic by a number of faculties. So I'll recommend each and every aspirant to just go for it.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Unacademy

spraveen297MouthShut Verified Member,"India, Andhra Pradesh, Visakhapatnam India",42 Reviews,Abundant knowledge with lack of perfection,"Dec 14, 2017 09:48 PM",3074 Views,"Unacademy initially started as a YouTube channel whose main aim was to provide coaching for the Civil Services aspirants for free. Roman Saini was the first teacher who started teaching lessons in this YouTube channel. He qualified the civil services examination and was serving as an IAS officer. But still he wanted to help the students in gaining insights about the civil services examination and hence he was teaching. Later Roman Saini and Gaurav Munjal together founded Unacademy. After becoming an e learning platform, UN Academy became one of the most popular online tutoring website. It acted as an interface between so many tutors as well as students. The best part about this e learning platform is that it is free of cost to learn anything. Initially it was free but later voluntary contribution option was given and now some of the premium courses are also provided by unademy.COURSES OFFERED:All the courses in unacademy are offered in line with the competitive examinations regarding government jobs and other entrance tests. Some of the main courses are related to SSC CGL examination civil services examination, IES examination, CAT examination,  RRB examination, different bank examination and other state level examination. Apart from these, the following courses are offered:English learning.Motivational.Personality development.Career counselling.Interview tips. Etc.FEE: No fees is charged for learning through this platform. It's absolutely free. But if the learners feel satisfied with the content and if they are helped by these platform in any way then they can pay an optional fee which depends upon themselves. But recently some premium courses were also offered like current affairs premium.APP AND WEBSITE DESIGN:To be frank the design and layout of the website or the application is not that attracting it feels boring and somewhat un interesting. Basically the videos take much more time to buffer which becomes a big headache for the learners and obviously it is a factor of time wastage. Sometimes the Android app stuck in the middle of the video which irritates the learner as he is in the middle of a lesson aue course with so much of concentration. But as they have offered the option of off-lining the videos which can be watched any number of times from anywhere without internet.QUALITY OF VIDEO CLASSES: There are so many problems related to the video quality, the first thing is the audio in some courses the audio is too loud and in Some other courses the audio is too low and in Some other courses the audio is somewhat disturbing and irritating. Some of the slides provided in the video of very good quality but most of the slides which are used for teaching I'm not having that better quality and some of the slides are just the pictures of the notes which the tutors have written.The video length is basically from 10 minutes to 15 minutes which is a great thing as we can learn many things within a small period of time. But as the unacademy educator app is having some default functions such as the tutors have to complete a particular lesson within 10 minutes which forces the tutors to teach at a fast pace and makes them uncomfortable while explaining which can be reflected in the understanding of the learner, mostly the learner gets confused because of that thing. The marker tool used to teach is not a marker at all it just disappears after every touch on the screen. Because of the unavailability of a better marker tool the educator don't get the opportunity to outline or mention some statistics which they want to provide to the learners.TUTORS: Well there are a number of tutors on uncademy most of them are not worth mentioning. Among some of the best tutors on this platform, a few are:Roman SainiRahul AgarwalVenkatesh ChaturvediChetan mnaArpita PrakashBhavin sangoiAbhishek SrivastavaDeepanshu SinghVimal Singh Rathore etc. There is no pre planned and well designed filtering method of tutors on this platform. Almost anybody who applies get an opportunity to publish his or her own teaching videos. This thing has deteriorated be teaching quality in unacademy. Most of the tutors don't have the ability to teach the content in an effective manner and their voice struggles a lot in the vibrations of fear. Some tutors just read out the matter given in the slides rather than explaining them and making the tutors understand the concept.USEFULNESS: Well as an educational website this is one of the best website which can help many students in our country to prepare for competitive examinations and get. And it is very much helpful as a tool for revision. It is one of the greatest Treasures of knowledge.POSITIVE POINTS:Wide range of courses.Availability of best tutors from all over the country.Provides good guidance for competitive examinations.Motivates the learners.And traditional and new way of teaching.24/365 days availability of classes forever.Free of cost education.Easy accessibility.NEGATIVES:Lack of proper selection procedure for tutors.Abundance of material and knowledge with so many drawbacks.Technical problems in Android app and website.Lack of proper schedules.Same courses are made by number of tutors.Too many courses confuse the learner.Too many incomplete courses. Overall unacademy as an online learning platform is a gift for so many poor students across the country who can access the coaching for the preparation of competitive examinations. And the best part is that it is not commercial. Wide variety of tutor options are available to the learners and they can choose the best tutor who can let them understand many complicated concepts. But on technical lines the website has to be developed a lot.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Unacademy

Sandeshkmr,New Delhi India,20 Reviews,Most useful educational site,"Aug 19, 2017 07:51 PM",3467 Views,"Unacademy being a free educational site can be very useful in terms of preparing and developing a proper outlook of competetive exams, both to the students in urban areas and also to those from small towns. For me its been a really fruitfull experience when I needed to gather information for CSE, whether it is pattern of the exam or the basic preparation needed  from the early stage. Initially I expected it to be normal site with some informative videos, later it was surprising for me to see their vast network of unacademy tuitors. I won't be doing justice if I do not mention about Roman Saini who is one of the co-founder of unacademy. Apart from having the most celebrated career, his style of teaching is really appealing. This site has a friendly interface and can be easily used by anyone. It has  different variety of programs to study for, it was really helpful for me to study english and its daily newspaper analysis is my favourite part on days when I could not access the newspapers. The problem which I face using this site is that due to their approach to  cover different set of topics in the limited time, sometime they miss out the important details. I can get upper outlook of the course but when it comes to the deep knowledge of those topics I lacks behind.

carlpiaf,,1 Review,Wasted money,"Feb 15, 2022 12:32 PM",1472 Views,"First, I have to say that my perspective is as a highly educated international education and IT professional, and not that of an Indian undergraduate. My experiences with upGrad have been extremely unsatisfactory. First, once they have your details, they pester you with a deluge of marketing and upSelling. They won't leave you alone. They try to get every single medium for communication from you, email, Telegram, etc. and constantly pressure you to refer a friend, even before your course starts. Added to this, they never listen to feedback. The course I was on was filled with errors, the video information is far too slow when covering the simplest stuff, then speeds through the more complicated material. It is frankly extremely poor educational content. As well as this, their student support is extremely poor, as is their attitude to their customers. It is as if they don't care once they have your money. I would NEVER recommend them to anyone wishing to improve their education.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

bonyl1994,India,1 Review,Best in class,"Jun 02, 2021 12:29 PM",13191 Views,"I joined UPGRAD for AI and ML PG program in the May2021 batch. I was confused, which course, which institute/college, online or offline, masters or PG program. The following points helped me to decide, might help you too.UPGRAD is not just an online certification program. It is definitely not distance education or correspondence. It is a Master’s or diploma DEGREE.There are a lot of people saying that you can get similar content on EDX, Coursera, Learnbay, etc. But one should know that these are not affiliated with any university or college.The degree which you will receive will be directly from the college like IIIT Bangalore, IIT Madras, Liverpool University, etc. and NOT from UPGRAD.Upgrad is WES certified which can give you 35 odd POINTS to your CRS for Canadian PR and others. No other course can give you that.They have articulation feature where you can convert your PG program to masters at any point of time, that is 12Months to 18Months.They have weekly 3 live lectures which is very good and they divide the batch to micro-batches. These things matter a lot.From day 1, I started applying in the own job PORTAL which only showed relavant jobs and was very easy to apply.Lastly, for working people, UPGRAD is so damn flexible with the timings, exams, live lectures, mobile app and web app.Also, cost of the program will also reduce as they have discounts going on everytime, you just need to insist. Also, referral codes can get you upto 35K discount which is a lot. You can use mine BONY433 or ask me any questions regarding this on LinkedIn",Upgrad

jayagarwal,"Delhi, India India",1 Review,UpGrad and IIIT Bangalore [PG Diploma in Data Sci],"Apr 13, 2021 02:00 AM",10134 Views,"I am a current student at UpGrad and IIIT Bangalore program so will be speaking out of experience. But one major update before it. The program is now called PG Diploma in Data Science. Now the curriculum is still the same but I am assuming that for future batches the name change is going to be extremely beneficial. Let me share my views on the following aspects of the program:Curriculum- The curriculum is in depth. It covers topics in Data Management, Statistics and Machine Learning. It also covers Big Data Analytics at an introductory level. Finally the best part is the domain elective and Capstone Project. While the initial topics are covered by Professors from IIIT-B and with some industry perspective- the domain electives are taught by really senior Industry Leaders. E-Commerce is taught by Ujjyaini Mitra(ex- Head of Analytics at Flipkart) and BFS is taught by Hindol Basu(Head of Analytics at Tata Industries).Pedagogy- I was uncertain how the pedagogy will be before joining an online program but I was surprised for good. Basically the pedagogy is very hands on. Let me take an example from Machine Learning. First you are given a business context and the business problem, then you are taught how an algorithm actually works(the maths behind it) and finally you are taught how to use the algorithm to solve the problem(using R). So only if you are looking to focus on all three elements should you consider this program.Diploma in Data Science- I think this is one of the strongest plus points of this program. I have done some MOOCS but all I get is a certificate of completion which trust me, everyone has these days. A PG Diploma in Data Science(a degree), I am hoping will really help me differentiate myself but since I am still pursuing this program, only time will tell how much value it adds.Career Support- My Batch has started 4 months ago so career support is just beginning but so far I am satisfied. Essentially they help you a lot in terms of preparing you resume, understanding the data science landscape, conducting mock interviews etc. The good part is all of this is done by industry experts in their network through one on one phone calls(yeah it is personalised). I still cannot comment on the type of career opportunities provided as that phase has not started yet. But in the previous cohort from what I know, around 130 folks out of 290 have been applying to these opportunities and out of them 45–50 have transitioned so far. The career support for the first batch is still going so let us see where this number ends(so the program is 11 month long and you get career support in total around 8–9 months- even after the program ends). I would not ignore the part time opportunities that you can also get through the program- especially paid mentorship/grading that you can do with UpGrad itself if you successfully complete the program. I know my peers who joined the first batch and are earning anywhere between 20k–30k per month(depending upon the time that they give) on the side by contributing back and building more experience in analytics.Price- I am still to complete the program and realize its value but so far it has been worth it. It becomes a one stop well threaded platform for learning data science. You get a reputed degree, you are taught by academic and industry leaders and get the best possible learning. On top of that the career support(both part time and full time) seems promising. I am not a big fan of MOOCs(which also by the way are going towards a paid model), because they are just collection of videos. Ultimately you have to realise that you will get what you pay for.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Upgrad

draconianhatecorr,"Dehra Dun, India India",1 Review,Out of the box Teaching,,10170 Views,"First I want to give advice to all the people please don't believe in these stupid comments and if you think  I am their student well I am not.Think from your own mind why a reputed institute like IIT, IIIT, NMIMS, and many other business schools tie-up with them.Let's Talk about their teachers you think they are young sorry but they all are above 40-45 and this I can tell you from my imaging software.Neither their technologies are outdated that's not the problem the main problem is in you or your child that he can't run with the pace wich other's can't and we are not school student that you been served everything in the platter. you have to study from other books, websites you will get the different examples to solve, newer cases then discuss them with your mentor.Member HC Verma, Halliday, Resnick and Walker, ML Khanna you use for preparing IIT.  Isn't Ncert enough? I haven't read this book in my life because I have one short at giving GRE at the form is very expensive so I took the money from all those books and keep saving the money and read Ncert. So, when IIT exams came just like other parents my parents to fill up the form IIT, BITS to Manipal university and you can give GRE 4 times in a year but I have one short and I take that short and after a lot of convincing my parent agreed to send me to MIT of course with the loan and right now I am completing my Master's in management just a semester away and half of 500fortune are in my contact to provide me the salary I want and how did I do that simply studying NCERT and to read extra or to practice I have many good friends who themselves are preparing for entrance.so, we started group studying after boards because we all have bungalows, cars but we live like nerds our group has 4 girls as well but once we are in the study mode we don't know when the day becomes night and whatever form we filled we all get selected and everyone took admission into IIT's except me, so my friend came on mom's request and give the excuse that aunty once he sees the campus and environment he will surely join but next day I stay at his play and then GRE exams for which I and my friend went to Delhi. I wrote the exam and I got selected but then we came home mom and dad were angry that where I am. I told them that I have been selected and the required amount. MY grandpa gives his savings more or less 15lac and the rest my dad arranged so I don't have to take any loans.so, the conclusion is no-one teaches you anything they just provide you pdf's, videos, assignments but are they beneficial for you is on you whether you want to learn or not. The world becomes digitalized you find every other book, research online. So, don't blame them it is you who couldn't cope up.  I knowwhat's my connection with that because my friends who study with me are here with me and they all do different courses from the upgrade and each of them is either promoted with a salary hike and someplace with big giants like Facebook, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, Apple, and some others and seeing them more people are encouraged to do the courses as they are cheaper as well. so, before pointing a finger at someone, make sure your hand is clean.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

I selected upgrad after viewing its free course in startup India for entrepreneurs. I found it is good and structure through which they conduct the course was motivating.if someone needs to upskill in a specific field using online course self-discipline is a must. there won't be any push or connection with the mentors or with the peer but still, you have to push your self to get interested in your learning and improve the skill by going through course. upgrad has some motivation strategy which they give as a badge to give a sense of learning with a peer with the competition.first and far most is its content, the knowledge they provide is immense. they bring the experts as the faculty so apart from the concept they also share their experience. which is like enabling you to be street smart. here I mean learning and applying the learning is two sides of the coin. one must know how to use the knowledge they have. in that way when experts share how they used it on the daily job it was interesting and taking students to the next level of understanding.so here I vote upgrad as a leader in teaching new edge technology that is a trend in the current market.I wish to encourage learning by sharing my experience but with upgrad I have one more privilege of giving a benefit for my peer learners that is the referral code which only a student of upgrad can provide to another student to encourage them for upskilling.Happy learning and happy sharing.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

First, I will talk about pros.Pros:1.This program is designed for working professionals. As it is an online course, you can attend lectures and read content in any point of time in a day. It is recorded and kept in UpGrad Servers and can be accessed through Internet. It is very flexible and easy for working professionals to budget their time as course is available 24 x 7.2.UpGrad have provided very good platform for attending lectures and read content. The content is really useful and assessment provides you confidence about what you have learnt in this course.3.Faculty is made of Professors from IIIT Bangalore and industry experts which helps you to understand concept of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence very well. Faculty is very experienced and knows what they are teaching.4.UpGrad assigns one mentor to students. They work round the clock to encourage / motivate you in your tasks progress and to complete your tasks before deadline. Student can share non academic concern to them and they are very responsive on solving issues. Personally, I have shared my concern to student mentor and it got resolved in very less time which allows you to concentrate in course.5.Live sessions and base camps are cherry on cake which helps us on Online Course progress as well as current technology usage in terms of ML & AI.6.This program have been designed as such beginners can start learning from zero to a great level.Cons:1.You need to invest your 10 - 12 hours(as per UpGrad, may be more required if student is beginner) per week for learning. You need to plan your study, work and personal time very carefully to complete this course.2.If you miss your deadline for completing assignments, case studies, learning modules, etc. 30% to 100% penalty is awarded to the student.3.Course fee is little costly in compare to other courses available in market but if you compare course syllabus, it will be worth to spend this amount on your upskill and getting recognized from IIIT Bangalore.I believe cons are actually positive in term of completing your learning on time as it pushes student to avoid delay in finishing checkpoints and helps them to complete course on time, but it definitely eats up your personal / free time.In my opinion, its good to stay relevant at current technology trend. In the end, its up to you to go ahead and decide what is best for you. I have given some points to consider before moving to decision.I'm about to complete my PGDDS program and If anyone want to connect regarding same program please ping me on this phone no.:+91971272xxxxFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

After completing 2 years as a full stack developer post-college, I wanted to learn what I had in mind since college i.e. Big Data technology. As with anything else, the best time to learn seemed now.I was looking for a certification program that would help me dive deep into data science and I was looking through a course that also offered the convenience of part-time and offline options for networking. I started my research about the Data Science courses that are available in India and many courses popped up, both online and offline.One of them was UpGrad's Data science program in partnership with IIIT-Bangalore. Little did I know, when I asked around,  that one of my friends had already signed up for this. Since I knew about the credibility of the college and the fact that they would provide a postgraduate diploma at the end of it, I decided to go for this course.The course was, without a hint of doubt, excellent! It gave me an overall structure of how a data science project was done in the industry, the various algorithms used and the steps they follow. I also learnt Python for data sorting from the online content and to implement the concepts I learned in the course.Finally, when I got a job in data science through UpGrad, it was easy for me to relate to the process they follow once I got into the role.#GotanUpGrad.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

happymanheman,India,1 Review,"If “Data is the new oil”, Upgrad is GOLDEN TOOL!!","Mar 15, 2018 09:50 PM",20965 Views,"“Data is the new oil”, told by renowned business tycoon Mr. Mukesh Ambani during the JIO launchprogram. I was quite excited after hearing this statement, since I work as a Database administrator.Oracle has the highest market share of 45.6% of RDBMS Data around the world and I am enthusiasticto be able to manage that huge Data. I deal with TBs of Data daily, while I work with networkinggiant Cisco Systems Inc. I work as a Senior Software Engineer and Oracle DBA SME at Tech MahindraLtd. and believe that people might live without electricity, but they can never live without Data.Data can be in any form and humans have this immense ability to save it either in their memory or inany electronic form of memory. Storing the Data in a Database has many techniques andtechnologies. DBMS and RDBMS being very popular and most reliable approach for storing sensitiveData. Years back, I was very happy that I landed on a right platform to explore my technical skills. Ieven thought that without a DBA, people will hang themselves!:) So, life was good all these yearswith my understanding on Data Storage and its importance.Very recently Big Data bee stung the whole world(IT) and people(IT) have lost their minds learningand upskilling themselves and getting healed. I wanted to be one step ahead of the crowd and thismade the Sherlock Holmes inside me start the investigation. I wanted to find whether to learn howto store different types of data or to find how to analyse and give value to the stored data. I figuredout that you can store any Data in any form using one or the other technology. All you need isstorage devices, storage mechanisms and finally unlimited power to keep the storage servers up andrunning.Data is ever-growing, and I finally felt like ""making sense out of stored data” made more sense to methan “learning many ways of storing data"". That very moment, I realised the power of data analytics.If Big Data can be compared to raw food material, then Data Science can be compared to deliciouscuisine. I made my mind that for the rest of my life, I want to spend munching that delicious cuisinerather than consuming unwanted raw food materials.My quest for best cuisine started in the beginning of the year 2017. I googled many pages, blogs,websites and tried some demo courses. But I wasn't entirely satisfied. I saw many flaws in most ofthe offering.One fine day, I came across UpGrad, which was offering one such Data Science course to the world.Curious me, started searching more on Quora and other known forums. Believe it or not, I was spell-bound and was quite convinced of the program.Best thing which can happen to a guy like me is ""UpGrad+ IIIT-B"".  PGDDS from ""UpGrad+ IIIT-B"" isall you need to become a professional Data Scientist. It had everything in it.Best UniversityBest Market PresenceBest ContentComplete online moduleBest talent nurturing program by mentoring each and every studentBest placement assistance and placementBest evaluation matrixI joined this course immediately after so much of analysis and I am happy with my decision today.My experience with UpGrad is very good with lots of academic challenges where I am tested everysingle day and I love it.If Data is the next big thing, UpGrad is the way to make it big!Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

alayshah1995,India,1 Review,A COMPLETE PACKAGE!!!,"Feb 07, 2018 07:49 PM",20964 Views,"Well, to be clear, the major role of Upgrad is to take care of the delivery of the course content instead of worrying much about what is delivered. This is because, they are basically partnering with top notch universities for helping working professionals to up skill their present skills. Thus, rather then commenting much about the content, since content is not a worrying issue because it is already delivered by renowned universities and hence it has to be extraordinary, I would like to provide a feedback regarding the role of Upgrad.So, I would like to share my personal experience and will conclude it with a feedback. When I was about to enroll, I was bit suspicious about the service, and hence had a detailed conversation with the program coordinator who promised me to deliver the following services:1) Cutting-edge curriculum2) Smooth Experience on the learning platform3) One to one mentor-ship to each student.4) Resume/CV Preparation and Placement ServiceAnd here come the feedback.P.S: There's also a short feedback for the ones in hurry, who may get scared by looking at my long answers!1) Cutting-edge curriculum:Short Feedback: I guarantee you will learn the latest skills that the industry demands.Long Feedback:As I said, the course is delivered by reputed universities, hence they have a strong curriculum with the latest skills demanded by the industry. Not only this, they have made every effort by replicating the real-world problems and assigning us that problems in the form of case studies. Hence, you get a lot of opportunity to put your freshly learnt skills into action. And, as we all know, we learn the maximum by doing, instead of just memorizing. Furthermore, what separates Upgrad from its competitors is there smart structuring of the course in terms of weekly deadlines. This methodology helps us to push our limits by creating a constant stress, which eventually leads to successful completion of the course. And that's the secret sauce behind maximum completion of courses that Upgrad experiences on its platform! And by the way, sessions by industry experts is a cherry on the cake here!:)2) Smooth Experience on the learning platformShort Feedback: A flawless Experience.Long Feedback:Personally, I have a very low patience and tolerance level. But Upgrad never really checked my patience. I don't remember a day when the website crashed, or I had to wait for minutes for the videos to load. Till now, I thought only Sillicon Valley has the powers to deliver a seamless experience, but Upgrad surely raised the bars which I always brag about! Respect!3) One to one MentorshipShort Feedback: They would do their best to keep you on toes! You cannot even try to run away for a week!Long Feedback:I have completed many online courses from a lot of MOOC's which has a world wide recognition, and who always promise and brag about there mentor-ship service. But trust me, there's no comparison between them and the service provided by Upgrad. For sure, Upgrad wins by a whole lot of margin. Infact, mentorship service provided by Upgrad and by other MOOC is not even in the same universe! To exemplify,i) There repeated reminders through mail and text and calls.ii) If you get stuck anywhere in the course, they will be virtually present to help you out within next 12 hours. And will not leave you until you are satisfied and your issue is resolved.To cut a long story short, they take our problem seriously by placing there feet in our shoes, and helps us out meticulously. Hats off to the mentorship team. To be honest, there mentorship service is there strongest part!4) Placement Service.Well, I am still not the best person to comment on this, since I have not yet reached at that stage. I am just halfway through the course. But seeing their commitment, I can predict they are going to win here as well.Conclusion:To conclude, they are surely delivering what the promised for. Hence, I strongly recommend Upgrad to anyone, without any reservations! If you still have any doubts regarding the Upgrad Service, my personal advice to you is:""Please give it a shot, I assure you would not regret your decision.""Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

akan21na,Bhubaneswar India,1 Review,Not just a bridge course.,"Jan 31, 2018 08:56 PM",19985 Views,"Being a computer science engineering graduate, I was a salesforce trainee in one of the biggest MNCs in the country today. But the passion in pursuing business and a want to complete my MBA made me quit the job pretty soon. I went on to start a handmade jewellery business with my cousin which in turn welcomed me with many challenges right from marketing to selling of the product. There were a number of road blocks in the journey, right from e-commerce giants not listing the products at our desired rates to my lack of social media marketing knowledge. This further motivated me to get out of my comfort zone and I started to look for options that would help me overcome my constraints. As I googled my way into learning new things, Google introduced me to this course of Digital Marketing  by MICA and UpGrad.At first, I wasn’t aware of UpGrad but I was well aware of its collaborating partner, MICA which is a world class institute. This in turn attracted me to the program and I enrolled myself in what has turned out to be a roller coaster ride for me in terms of my business and giving me a hands on experience for the coming days.Coming from an engineering background and having a specialization in computer science, I have come across various software/hardware technologies and also have got hands on experience in few of them. Yet, I was initially skeptical of e-learning. However, those apprehensions were quashed thanks to UpGrad, its platform and the way they execute teaching.The best thing about UpGrad and its way of teaching is its interface which impressed me the most at first sight. The way they have designed every single page in every session in every module is really commendable. Even a lazy person would go through every video and question provided at the end of the sessions without wanting to skip any.Second, their idea of mixing the SMEs. The learners benefit by learning from eminent corporate leaders, business academicians, industry connoisseurs. These experts share their valuable insights on the relevant, practical and must know aspects of the corporate world which is in turn not only useful but also prepares you for the real world, something that offline universities totally lack.Third, the course design, its curriculum, the webinars, the case studies are all designed in a very interactive and professional way.  If in case you have a concern, we are advised to interact with the Student Mentors who help us out with any queries or technical problems any time of the day. The Student Mentor’s promptness at every roadblock is very much appreciated.Through UpGrad, I completed my Facebook marketing certification. It has immensely helped me gain a lot of engagement on my facebook business page and in collateral brought a lot of reliable customers along with it. And that’s not it. I even had an opportunity to run display ads for a known business brand.The USP of this course from UpGrad is that it is highly reliable. Something that every professional who looks forward to learn how digital marketing  works, transition into digital marketing domain and a fresher who wants to start off into his/her passion for marketing.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

Mr_Coschemos,Nagpur India,1 Review,A Story With a Purpose,"Jan 31, 2018 03:42 PM",18559 Views,"“The two most important days in your life are the day you are born and the day you find out why.” - Mark TwainI was first introduced to Facebook back in 2010. Now we are witnessing one person’s mission of giving people the power to build community and bringing the world closer together. It’s none other than, Internet Entrepreneur Mark Zuckerberg’s mission for Facebook. It has such energy to create a platform for people like us to utilize our skills, talent, and also for advertisers to help them connect with their respective audience. His team’s contribution to social media is remarkable.This will always inspire me to work with integrity and with a purpose.I am Chetan and I’m a content and social media marketer and a healing practitioner. I also deliver sessions to the students who don’t have access to the computer and other facilities of modern education. Through my sessions, I learned that in many parts of the country, students don’t even know about Gmail but they have high aspirations towards working in private sector and individuals who want to contribute in the economy. That inspired me to look at how India can be developed through multiple dimensions of innovation.To all the readers, this article will save your hundreds of hours of research and help you find out your “WHY” behind joining the course. Most importantly, I’ll be 95% honest with you. Nope, just kidding. Google knows everything. I’m just trying to be more conversational than simply narrating a story so that you must not miss the important message of the content.A short disclaimer before we start: I’m writing this article on behalf of all the cohorts of my batch August ‘17 and on the basis of my past 34 months of extensive research. I take complete responsibility for my reviews about UpGrad Digital Marketing Program and can be verified further on the internet.Since my graduation days, I started working during my semester vacations as a trainee marketer. UpGrad was just launched when I got introduced to digital marketing, publishers, advertisers, ad network, etc. during my college placements.I started learning by myself, but it took a whole lot time learning randomly from the internet. I approached many professionals for guidance but most of them suggested me to go for IT because I’m an ENGINEER.For me, it was not just about a job but more about delivering what you have, when you put your heart and soul into it. It’s about the single task with a purpose that I’d love to follow for the rest of my life. I couldn't stop myself and continued my research. I found many articles helpful including an article from digitaldeepak. After exploring almost all top institutions and platforms that are offering the digital marketing program. I selected few of them - Market Motive(Simply learn), DSIM, Digital Vidya, Manipal, EduPristine, UpGrad and also programs offered by recognized universities around the globe.While I was in chaos, my mentor guided to me dream bigger. To learn where simply person’s presence can give me an experience. My goals aligned with UpGrad's Digital Marketing Program and I decided to begin my journey with it.The team has a successful record in the past, a clear vision and ready plan for execution. UpGrad is itself a perfect case study where we can correlate everything that we learn in the program. A successful execution. It keeps on UpGrading day by day.I’m a huge fan of Ronnie Screwvala. When I came to know about his venture in online education, I didn’t have to analyze much and finally decided to go with UpGrad & MICA. I truly believe in his leadership and vision. His book “Dream with your eyes open” inspired me to look at the things as an entrepreneur would.Few things assured my decision for joining the course. One of them is the history of MICA which was started by the DDB Mudra Group, India's first and largest integrated marketing communications and services network.It’s truly an honor to be a part of institutions like MICA and UpGrad.I wanted to learn the basics and Nagpur based one of the leading Digital Marketing Agency, Convomax, gave me an opportunity for an internship for 6 months to start off with my Digital Career. My journey with UpGrad officially started in August 2017 and I haven’t regretted my decision of transitioning into this industry.The complete program of UpGrad is well structured and they exactly know the pain points of today’s marketer & the skills gap that industry is facing. I especially liked the concept of a T-shaped marketer. That gave me a clear idea about each and every field in detail(SEM, SEO, SMM, etc.) and helped me choose the one which I intend to specialize in. Thanks to Vanhishikha Bhargava for mentorship & guidance. The beauty of the program is everyone is eligible for the program if you are clear about what you want at the end of the program.It was a wonderful experience to learn from MICA faculty and TEDx Speaker and Professor at Cambridge University, Jaideep Prabhu. The live sessions with industry experts were also helpful.In addition, free lecture modules of UpGrad’s Startup India Learning program gave me a brief understanding of Entrepreneurial journey.The exciting part of the program is, even if you are learning online, you get a feeling of sitting in a classroom and engaged all the time. UpGrad is the place where you share your passion. The only need is to be hungry to learn each and every aspect of the program. The leadership forum gave me a competitive environment and also a chance to interact with other cohorts of the program through online & offline meetups such as BaseCamp.Throughout the program, while interacting with the UpGrad team, I learned how to be an ideal professional. Because it’s not about selling what you have but to get connected with others. Big thanks to the team. I don’t know how you guys handle your personal and professional life because you were always there for us.To all who are aspired to make a career transition or who are looking to grow in their respective field, have a clear vision, goal and written execution plan before opting for this course. Ask yourself, WHY do you want to join this course, how others(a company you work for or your startup) will get benefited if you become an expert in your field. Your wish will be granted at UpGrad. And that's a promise. If you're prepared, the opportunities are also on their way. Because there is something in this world you were put here to do that only you can do.Thank you very much for sparing your precious time.Follow this link for further details. https://bit.ly/2BFoHcOFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

vibhorsrivastava67,Hyderabad India,1 Review,My experience and Journey with UpGrad,"Jan 28, 2018 12:15 PM",53172 Views,"My experience and journey with UpGradI was a call centre employee working for an International BPO. I wasn’t much interested in it. The only thing which helped me while working as a call centre agent is English communication skills as I got a good command over the language while speaking to with Americans. But I genuinely wasn’t satisfied as I had already set goals to pursue something very different, all by self.I was shortlisted for ICICI Bank PO programme in February 2014. I underwent seven months of rigorous training at ICICI Manipal Academy, Bangalore and finally got posted in Business Intelligence Unit department of ICICI Bank, at its regional office in Gachibowli, Hyderabad. I did not had any prior experience in the data analytics industry then but after joining the bank in a department where analytics happens to be the core part of the job, I developed an interest for data analytics and hence I was looking forward to join a course which helps understand data analytics and improve my analytical skills. Thanks to facebook, it introduced me to PGDDA course from UpGrad and IIIT-Bangalore. I inquired about this course and read its reviews. Later, I decided to join as it was being offered by a premier institute as esteemed as International Indian Institute Of Information Technology, Bangalore.PGDDA course from UpGrad and IIIT-Bangalore has happened fortunately to me and it has helped enhance my skills in Excel, SQL, R etc. It has been 8 months almost since the course has started and UpGrad has exposed me to all the challenges and developments which would happen in a real scenario in the data analytics industry.As far as my experience and journey with UpGrad and IIIT-Bangalore is concerned, I would like to say that joining this course in cohort-2 has truly been a quite wonderful opportunity as I came across lot of analytical minds(my batchmates) along the way and I have befriended a few who have immense knowledge about data analytics and whose help, I believe can be very useful whenever I need them.Apart from modules and lectures from various professors, the only thing which inspires me is the useful questions and answers session which keeps on happening on a daily basis in the discussion forum.Case studies and Assignments in each module have further helped me develop as an analyst and I have full faith that this experience would come in handy at times when I undertake any critical projects in future.I would like to extend my warm regards and thanks to the following professors for illuminating us with their knowledge and I would say that they are a very rich and vital sources of education.1.Professor RC: A special thanks to Sir for helping me understand the basics of R, SQL, Data Ware Housing, CRISP-DM framework, tableau.2.Professor Anand: He is the one who I can look upto in case I need any help about EDA and MS Excel.3.Professor Tricha: For helping me gaining insights into hypothesis testing.4.Professor Dinesh Bapu Jayagopi: For his effective teaching of linear regression with relevant examples and brilliant thought process. I got a golden opportunity to meet him in person at UpGrad Basecamp in Hyderabad, on October 8th.5.M/S Ujjaini: For sharing her valuable learnings on linear regression and model selectionProfessor G.Srinivasraghavan: For taking up the PA-2 course and assisting us grasp the concept of Support Vector Machines with an easy elaboration of relevant and to the point examples.Faculty at UpGrad has been very supportive and helpful. I would like to thank my student mentor Vanshika Agrawal, under whose guidance and mentorship, I have come so far in this course.Finally, I would like to signoff saying that PGDDA course from UpGrad and IIIT-Bangalore will give India the best Data Analysts of tomorrow who will become a very crucial part of the analytics domain and industry.UpGrad in association with IIIT-Bangalore is reshaping the future of business data analytics and supporting many data enthusiasts as I to realize getting the job of our dreams.It’s a great and best opportunity to all those people who are quite passionate and enthusiastic about analytics.

He will just sold and disappear after that. No SUPPORT after that.My main concerns are,1) They promised 9 hours of weekly classes but only maximum 6 hours happening in actual so it's 50% reduction on services hence NOT COMPLIED2) Personal Teacher is of no use, in actual there is no additional benefit of PT compared to what they explained before payment. PT has not shared any performance of kid, no support, he is just silent fellow, getting salary from parent for doing nothing and fraud my Vedantu.3) There is no weekly test on every Sunday as promised. They just upload it and leave it to kids wheather they want to do it or no.Based on the above 3 concers, I requested for my refund but they rejected my ticket so I am requesting this community to support me in highlighting this fraudulent activity to other parents and help me in getting my money back.Vedantu Ticket No for this Case 34923, vcare closed the ticket without providing solution and confirmation from customer which is against SLA and again NOT COMPLIED.Educational institutions are doing fraud , making money on the name of providing better education.Thank you,DineshFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunkThank You!

Today, my Kid was waiting for an hour for the meeting. The call  started well  with clear audio and video, and the teacher(Priya Garg) asked my kid to change the network. she shouldn't have done this when the network was working well. We changed the network and Mam never connected back on call. she kept chatting, asking to restart etc., and later asked us to schedule another meeting. Someone called me on the phone from your organization in the interim and he said - kay koi problem hai kya - I asked who you are and this is how you introduce a customer. He said his name is Rajeev and disconnected the phone call. Rajeev called me from 979836xxxx.I then called up your Customer service number, and talked to a CCR called Pramod. He promised that I will be receiving a complaint number for the recorded call. I haven't received it so far, and I am sure you don't care for this.Between 11.45am - 12pm today i.e. when meeting was scheduled, I received around 10+ phone calls and 3 message from your organization as confirmation(:-This is harassment from Vedantu.

In a nutshell if you ask the teachers are better than the most tution teachers in the locality.Product wise its superior than Byju's as we have used both of them. My younger daughter used byju's and now we are regretting.Interaction with the teacher is good and I have seen my child taking real interest in the classes.Above all I think the reason for liking Vedantu is their representative his name is Ashutosh Pandey. He is one of the most humble person with excellent subject knowledge. I have given his number to many of my friends and they have bought the course too.

sreeramk500,India,1 Review,Do not fall for Vedantu,"Jun 16, 2020 10:20 PM",2928 Views,"My experience with Vedantu is very bad.  I admitted my daughter for JEE online classes.  I paid Rs. 10000 with a condition to refund the amount if my daughter does not like the class.   After 2nd class itself, faculty/Support faculty were not clarifying doubts. They are asking my daughter to move on.  So we decided to withdraw from Vedandu.  So I called the salesperson and explained the issue and informed him to refund the amount.  Surprisingly, he said his responsibility is only to admit the students and refund is not.  He also said that, For this, I need to contact customer care.    So I sent an email to customer Care for a refund on 29th, 31st and again 2nd June.  So far I have not got the amount.The basic problem with Vedantu is there is no single point contact who can take responsibility from registration to exit.So I never recommend Vedantu to any one.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

visrom,hyderabad India,6 Reviews,Biggest fraudsters,"Jun 08, 2020 05:02 PM",3563 Views,"I must say.the teachers are actually ok. But this Vedantu platform is a huge fraud. First my son watched a few free master classes and he liked them.  I didn't have to do anything. They called me in 2 days and asked me to take the full JEE package for 33K. When I said it's too much, the sales person asked me to pay 6K for a trial 15 days and promised that within 15 days if I don't like it, they would refund without any questions. Then they did a video verification and created an account in my son's name and told me that they will call when the batch starts. I got an email saying that my son is registered into the ProLite version of Vedantu classes. I waited for an intimation about the class start date but nothing happened. Meanwhile my son's friend registered for the same ProLite version and told us that he got it for free! Then I called them up and asked my I am being charged for something that's free. The sales person or the call centre guy had no clear answer. They only talk to you till you pay. After that they block your numbers! Finally I got a call from the counsellor who said that the paid batch gets better teachers. I said fine, tell me when the batch is starting. She said she would inform me. I have been waiting for 20 days now, but no sign of any call from anyone. Then I sent an email asking for refund. Then one guy called and said that the batch has already started and that he tried by number 2 days back but couldn't reach me! This was a blatant lie! When they wanted payment, they even called me at 10 in the night but to inform the batch they didn't try a second time. They didn't even send an email or SMS notification about the batch starting. They are fraudsters.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Vedantu

Sad thing is that it's not much worthy as compared to other platform I'm not pointing out any other websiteThe only problem that lies with vedantu is they don't update their video they just tape video and they use it for a long time. But what I feel is there is many more things which we learn every day so if the videos are updated and shuffling of teachers will held so I'm sure it will enhance student knowledge. And I don't have any major problem with vedantu. Their facilities are knowledge. And they are also a good mentor.Let me know what you think ?? ??Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

deepakyadavaimdliMouthShut Verified Member,"Delhi, India India",8 Reviews,Worst education,"May 06, 2020 09:55 PM",2916 Views,"Vedantu may have good faculty members ( in terms of their knowledge) but the thing is they  aren't dedicated to their students/customers.They have number Of micro courses but all of them is not what they told about them( they say you can complete a topic or chapter for your jee but isn't true because they are incomplete in the sense they just give you a recorded  lecture of a particular topic or chapter of very old time & not updated yet) . Although the live lectures they give on their app is good but the worst thing is the app he use to give you the live lecture because the the app has some technical problems they doesn't update automatically about the schedule of the live lectures nor they update the PDFs & other materials they provide in real time.Mock test series is good.The course prices are reasonable although the number of courses are few( limited options like only for jee, neet, nda, kvpy etc but not for the other main exams like upsc cse) .In last because the vedantu app is the problem in itself, I suggest you all to not to waste your time in vedantu because other options are there better than this.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

These guys are doing a great great job!We were struggling to get exam help for my niece studying in 9th std. CBSE school. All the tuition teachers were busy wrapping up the courses for their existing students. It was giving panic attacks to my bhabhi to look for a good teacher in a small town like Faridkot. I heard about this website on radio and thought of checking them out for my niece.I called them up for a detailed introduction and how  to go about it for a kid who has average IQ and needs specific helps to score good in her exams. Mrs. Divya from their student care patiently heard my requirements and suggested a couple of teachers based on my requirements. We scheduled the trial class and woohhhaaaa! my niece was super impressed with the interaction, with the teacher, with the way the topic  was made understood, the way it is explained, the examples, with everything about these awesome people.My niece is pretty confident of her preparation and keep going to the portal for clearing her small doubts all by herself. They have an absolutely awesome feature that let's students clear their doubts with a teacher one-on-one and it can be a single question doubt as well.I sincerely want to thank the enire team behind making this concept available for the kids in remote and not-so-developed cities and helping them reach their potential by allocating someone who dedicatedly looks after the needs of the students.I am Super Impressed Team and would suggest all parents/ someone who have kids in their family to try Vedantu out. Great concept! I am sure these guys will make a huge dent in the perception of tuition in India and hopefully all across the world.Final take - Go, Give it a Try, You'll Not Regret!Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

But now its taken over by some other people and hence the user inter-face has become a little more boring . I personally used vendantu like 2 years before when I wanted tutoring for myself. It was really good service that was provided.But more the web page itself looks more like a knowledge base rather then a online tutorials.

dontgiveupMouthShut Verified Member,raebareli India,361 Reviews,Not recommended,"Dec 22, 2015 03:16 PM",32773 Views,"The most amazing venture of online tutoring in India at affordable prices is vedantu.com. Many school students from all parts of India are enrolled everyday on this website for learning. But, I must say that it is good to appreciate technology and way of learning but only teaching through internet is not effective to teach the children. In order to clear out their concepts and make them learn every day, physical tutor is required who can teach him by just sitting beside your child.In the same way, it is ineffective on the places where still there is no proper internet connection and problem of network connectivity access. I will never suggest anybody to use this website for tutoring their children.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Vedantu
IndianShakespeareMouthShut Verified Member,Kolkata India,34 Reviews,Excellent concept badly executed,"Dec 21, 2015 12:52 AM",53404 Views,"The concept of anytime tutor is an excellent one, and is the demand of future education in India. This concept already prevails in US, UK and many other foreign countries. But Vedantu hasn't been able to execute it properly in India. This is creating a negative impact in the minds of people who have tried it, and is thus spoiling this wonderful concept.If your child or you have too much time to spare, only then go and try this out. The waiting time is too high to tolerate.The customer service is not that user friendly as it should be, given that the focus market is school going children.Regularly switching over teachers is not very advisable for your child. Switch should only be made if the student demands to do so. Vedantu doesnot have fixed teachers at fixed hours, so a lot of switching of teachers is made.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Vedantu

Hence I tried available online tutors from your site.  Though some were ready and were on line  It is understood that they needed approval from your support Team.  So I keep trying  the support ""Chat"" Box.  After several attempts finally I could  get response from the  chat box support.  I pleaded that my son & I are anxiously waiting for the session and requested them to arrange the session  at least for 30 Minutes,  but  to our disappointment your support team informed that it is already 10.15 p.m. and hence it is not possible to find tutor that day.   They also blamed my laptop's screen resolution(HP Laptop which is already  lying in maximum pixels) without even starting the session.   To sum up my trial session experience with you-Though you are claiming anytime/anywhere teaching, this is not so in real experience(By 10.15 p.m. you are closing, and no support is given).it is a Bhageerathaprayatna(Herculian task) to finalize tutors in your site-Your live session perhaps may be useful in cities and METRO, where connectivity is not an issue, but in other parts of India it is not so.-A lot of time is to be wasted for getting  the tutors.-To-day trial session itself proved that much time would be wasted for net link, to find availablity of tutor, their acceptance and finally approval from the team.  All these consumes lot of time and not an easy task.and to conclude pl. note that even after spending 2 1/2 hours(evening 8 to 10.30 p.m.)in your site we couldn't get even 1 minute teaching session.Thanks for a brief association with you,Regds,Radhakrishnan.M.N., Palakkad, KeralaFlag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You!

StoneReviewMouthShut Verified Member,Cochin India,372 Reviews,Chose Your own time and Study anywhere,"May 29, 2015 06:39 PM",35199 Views,"Vedantu, sounds makes trouble, No Np, its a new online platform, unique feature  is that you can get a personal teacher that will help you to make study easy, smarter and friendly via online. I mentioned smarter, because most of the tutors are from IIT, BHU, NIT, BITS and other reputed universities and colleges in India. They provide tuitions for 6 to 10 on both CBSE and ICSE stream. Also  competitive exams like IIT JEE, National Talent Search Examination and PSA Exams.Sometimes students didn't like more that ordinary class,  because its hard to understand subject like maths, chemistry . So as usual they go  to tuition class, same problem may arise in these  also. So its is better to a tutor who talks us frenziedly and make study simpler and try to teach from students point of view. Then Vedantu is best place for you.Flag This ReviewIrrelevantFakeJunk   Thank You! We appreciate your effort.",Vedantu
